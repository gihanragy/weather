# Weather API

This is a Spring Boot application that provides weather data for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It has
two main endpoints:

- `/api/weather/{city}` - This endpoint is public and returns the current weather data for a given city.
- `/api/report/{city}` - This endpoint is secured with OAuth2 and generates a PDF weather report for a given city.
